# Exercise C
Feels ok, the problems are in the form, but solvable, because the presentation is oral :)

# Next exercise
The one solved is medium, suggested ones are from the logic, especially exercise G

Also semantics operators (from logic?):
- Exercise E: bisimulation in LTSs
- Exercise F: bisimulation and HML logic + recursive logic
- Exercise G: prove logic rules in mu-calculus
- Exercise H: negation in HML

## Exercise G
- Inv is easy
- Even and Until are more challenging
- Until strong and weak can be a candidate
